# 👋 Hi, I'm Chris Hegarty (CrackTheEgg)

🏗️ Former Construction Project Manager now focused on building scalable, intelligent cloud systems with AWS.

🔧 I started **Project Atlas** as a structured learning path to move from theoretical AWS knowledge to real-world architecture — and to ultimately contribute to global, ethical, cloud-native designs.

# 🗺️ Project Atlas

**Project Atlas** is a learning journey into real-world AWS Solution Architecture — from whiteboard to deployment. Each chapter builds a complete, practical cloud-native project while layering deeper skills across architecture, automation, cost-optimization, and secure design.

## 🤔 Why Atlas?

Cloud isn’t just infrastructure — it’s a way of thinking about **scalable, connected systems**. Solutions Architects today aren’t just solving technical problems for one app or team — they’re designing for resilience, security, and impact at scale.

**Atlas** reflects that shift: designing with the wider world in mind. It’s a learning journey that mirrors how real architects work — not just configuring services, but thinking systemically.

- From client brief ➝ to architecture diagrams ➝ to deployment ➝ to optimization  
- From simple triggers ➝ to distributed systems ➝ to meaningful impact  
- From services ➝ to systems ➝ to ecosystems  

It’s not just about learning AWS — it’s about learning to **think like an architect**: with clarity, empathy, and a global perspective.

## 🧱 The Learning Workflow

Each chapter follows this 6-step applied methodology:

1. 📝 **Client Brief** – Simulated client requirement with business & technical context
2. 🧠 **Written Response** – High-level interpretation + architectural reasoning
3. 🧭 **Architecture Diagram** – Visual translation of the proposed AWS design
4. ⚙️ **Build** – Real AWS deployment using IaC (CloudFormation or Terraform)
5. 🤖 **Automate** – CI/CD or serverless patterns where appropriate
6. 📈 **Optimize** – Cost, security, observability, and scalability reflection

Each chapter builds from the previous — technically and conceptually.
