# 👋 Hi, I'm Chris Hegarty (CrackTheEgg)

🏗️ Former construction project manager now focused on building scalable, intelligent cloud systems with AWS.

🔧 I started **Project Atlas** as a structured learning path to move from theoretical AWS knowledge to real-world architecture — and ultimately contribute to global, ethical, cloud-native design.

# 🗺️ Project Atlas

**Project Atlas** is a learning journey into real-world AWS Solution Architecture — from whiteboard to deployment. Each chapter builds a complete, practical cloud-native project while layering deeper skills across architecture, automation, cost-optimization, and secure design.

---

## 🤔 Why Atlas?

The cloud isn't just infrastructure — it's a **global architecture movement**. Solutions Architects are no longer designing for single apps or teams — they're engineering for scale, resilience, and global reach.

**Atlas** is named for that shift: designing with the wider world in mind. This project doesn't teach AWS in isolation. It mirrors how real-world architects think:

* From client brief ➝ to architectural diagrams ➝ to deployment ➝ to optimization
* From simple triggers ➝ to distributed systems ➝ to ethical impact
* From services ➝ to systems ➝ to ecosystems

This is'nt about just learning AWS — it's about learning to **think as architect's would**.

## 🧱 The Learning Workflow

Each chapter follows this 6-step applied methodology:

1. 📝 **Client Brief** – Simulated client requirement with business & technical context
2. 🧠 **Written Response** – High-level interpretation + architectural reasoning
3. 🧭 **Architecture Diagram** – Visual translation of the proposed AWS design
4. ⚙️ **Build** – Real AWS deployment using IaC (CloudFormation or Terraform)
5. 🤖 **Automate** – CI/CD or serverless patterns where appropriate
6. 📈 **Optimize** – Cost, security, observability, and scalability reflection

Each chapter builds from the previous — technically and conceptually.
