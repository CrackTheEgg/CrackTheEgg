# ðŸ“„ Client Brief â€“ Chapter 02: Online CV Website

---

## Overview

As part of building a strong online presence, I would like a personal website that acts as a digital version of my CV. It should highlight my background, education, and a growing portfolio of technical projects â€” especially those related to AWS and cloud computing.

This will help me showcase my skills to potential employers, clients, or collaborators, and give a professional first impression.

## Requirements

- A simple, clean, and professional design
- Mobile-friendly layout (works well on phones and tablets)
- Sections for:
  - Personal introduction
  - Work history & education
  - Skills & technologies
  - Links to my GitHub and AWS projects
- Hosted online with a public URL
- Fast loading and secure (uses HTTPS)

---

## Preferences

- Iâ€™d prefer the website to be low cost or ideally free to run
- I donâ€™t want to rely on WordPress or third-party builders
- If possible, Iâ€™d like to link it with my own custom domain later

---

## Future Additions (Optional)

- A blog or updates section
- Better portfolio features with images or animations
- Analytics to track how many people visit the site

**Thank you â€” excited to see what this could become!**
