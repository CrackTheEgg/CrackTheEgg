# PROJECT RESPONSE – CHAPTER 01: LAMBDA HELLO WORLD

**Prepared By:** Solutions Architect – Project Atlas Team\
**Date:** July 11, 2025\
**Audience:** Technical Reviewer / Delivery Lead

---

## BACKGROUND

This document outlines the proposed solution in response to the client’s requirement for a minimal, serverless proof-of-concept demonstrating AWS Lambda functionality with logging and optional API integration.

---

## OBJECTIVE

To deliver a self-contained, serverless compute function using AWS Lambda that:

- Executes upon manual or HTTP trigger
- Returns a static "Hello from Lambda!" response
- Uses CloudWatch for monitoring and observability
- Utilizes only AWS Free Tier services

---

## SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE

**Components:**

- **Client** – Manual Console Trigger or HTTP call
- **Amazon API Gateway** *(optional)* – Public access layer
- **AWS Lambda** – Stateless function execution
- **IAM Role** – Restricted logging permissions
- **Amazon CloudWatch** – Centralized logging and metrics

**Architecture Flow:**

```
User → [API Gateway] → Lambda Function → CloudWatch Logs
```

---

## IAM & SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

**Lambda Execution Role (Least Privilege):**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Security Highlights:**

- No public storage or persistent data exposure
- Function remains stateless and ephemeral
- IAM role scoped only to CloudWatch Logs

---

## DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

**Method:** Manual setup via AWS Console (no CLI/IaC)

**Steps:**

1. Create IAM Role with log access
2. Create new Lambda function with inline editor
3. Define and test basic input event or HTTP trigger
4. Verify logs in CloudWatch

---

## OBSERVABILITY & METRICS

- **CloudWatch Logs:** Function output and invocation detail
- **Basic Metrics:**
  - Invocation Count
  - Duration
  - Error Count

No additional monitoring or tracing will be configured at this stage.

---

## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

- Stateless and ephemeral design pattern
- Scales with Lambda concurrency defaults
- Entirely Free Tier eligible
- Minimum viable complexity

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- Lambda responds with "Hello from Lambda!"
- Logs appear in CloudWatch
- IAM role permissions validate successfully

---

## FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS

- API Gateway integration
- CI/CD automation
- Step Functions for orchestration
- Environment configuration management
