Project Response – Chapter 01: Lambda Hello World

Response Prepared By: Solutions Architect, Project Atlas TeamDate: July 11, 2025Audience: Technical Reviewer / Delivery Lead

🧩 Background

This response outlines the technical solution proposed to address the client’s brief for a lightweight, serverless proof-of-concept using AWS Lambda. The goal is to demonstrate functional viability, operational visibility, and cloud-native scalability with minimal configuration.

🎯 Objective

To implement a serverless Lambda function that:

Executes in response to an HTTP event or manual trigger

Returns the message "Hello from Lambda!"

Operates with minimal setup using AWS Free Tier services

Captures logs for observability via CloudWatch

🧱 Solution Architecture

Components:

Client – Developer invoking function manually or via browser/API

API Gateway (optional) – Provides public HTTP endpoint

AWS Lambda – Executes backend logic

IAM Role – Execution permissions for logging

Amazon CloudWatch – Stores logs and execution metrics

Architecture Flow:

User/Test Event → [API Gateway] → Lambda Function → CloudWatch Logs

🔐 IAM and Security

IAM Role: Lambda will use an IAM role with the following least-privilege permissions:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

No inbound public access to storage or compute

All resources are ephemeral

⚙️ Deployment Approach

All configuration and deployment will be manual via the AWS Console

Key steps:

Create IAM execution role

Create Lambda function using inline editor

Create a test event or HTTP trigger

View logs in CloudWatch

✅ This method avoids IaC/CLI for early-stage learning clarity

📊 Observability

CloudWatch will provide log access and usage metrics including:

Invocation count

Duration

Errors

No X-Ray tracing or detailed performance diagnostics are required at this stage.

🧠 Design Considerations

Stateless execution model

Scalable by default via Lambda concurrency

Free Tier usage keeps costs negligible

Ephemeral runtime and no persistent storage dependencies

✅ Success Criteria

Lambda can be invoked and returns the expected message

CloudWatch logs are available and reflect execution

IAM permissions work as intended with no excessive privilege

🧱 Next Steps

This PoC lays the foundation for future enhancements such as:

API Gateway integrations

Environment variables

CI/CD deployment

Step Functions for orchestration
